This suggests that warmer temperatures are generally associated with moderate increases in upcoming precipitation. However, this trend changes for the high precipitation category above 30 mm, where the median temperature is noticeably lower or similar to the preceding bins. This deviation is also reflected in the maximum temperatures, with the highest precipitation category showing significantly lower maximum temperatures compared to all other groups. This pattern indicates that heavy precipitation events tend to coincide with or possibly cause lower temperature extremes, which might be influenced by seasonal factors, cloud cover, or the cooling effects of sustained rainfall.\n",

       "<p style=\"color:grey\">feature_1_insights</p><h3 font-size: 3em>When precipitation fall is categorised into finer bins such as 0 to 10 mm, 10 to 20 mm, 20 to 30 mm, 30 to 40 mm, 40 to 50 mm and 50 plus mm, the median average temperature tends to increase slightly as precipitation increases from 0 up to 30 mm. This suggests that warmer temperatures are generally associated with moderate increases in upcoming precipitation. However, this trend changes for the high precipitation category above 30 mm, where the median temperature is noticeably lower or similar to the preceding bins. This deviation is also reflected in the maximum temperatures, with the highest precipitation category showing significantly lower maximum temperatures compared to all other groups. This pattern indicates that heavy precipitation events tend to coincide with or possibly cause lower temperature extremes, which might be influenced by seasonal factors, cloud cover, or the cooling effects of sustained rainfall.\n",

       "<p style=\"color:grey\">feature_engineering_3_explanations</p><h3 font-size: 3em>Features such as rain_sum_lag_1, rain_sum_lag_2 and rain_sum_lag_3 are created to capture rainfall amounts from the previous three days, providing the model with important context on recent precipitation patterns. In addition, rolling window features, including sums, means, maximums and minimums of rainfall over the past 3, 5 and 7 days (calculated with a one-day shift to prevent data leakage), are engineered to capture short to medium term trends. For example, the binary flag heavy_rain_flag_last_3d indicates whether there was heavy rain (exceeding 10 mm) in the past three days. These lagged and rolling features enable the model to better understand recent weather dynamics and the buildup of precipitation events, ultimately improving its ability to predict cumulative rainfall over the upcoming three day period.\n",

RMSE is particularly useful because it shares the same units as the target variable (precipitation in millimeters), making the magnitude of errors easy to interpret. However, RMSE penalises larger errors more heavily by taking the square root of the average squared errors, which helps highlight significant deviations in precipitation forecasts. This sensitivity can sometimes lead to larger RMSE values, especially in cases of class imbalance where extreme values occur less frequently. Hence, MAE is preferred as it provides a more balanced measure by treating all errors linearly, making it less sensitive to outliers and extreme values. Additionally, R-squared is included to quantify the proportion of variance in the observed data explained by the model, providing valuable insight into the overall goodness of fit and facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. However, R-squared can be affected by class imbalance, which impacts its interpretation in datasets with uneven distributions of rainfall events. When the dataset contains many more low rainfall events than high rainfall events, the model may perform well on the majority but poorly on the minority.
